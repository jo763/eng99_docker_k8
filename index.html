  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Hello, I am a chemical engineering graduate from the University of Surrey with one year's industrial experience in nuclear safety within the fire team at Atkins.
    I have achieved Upper Second Class Honours (2:1) in my Master's of Chemical Engineering degree. Details of the modules I have studied and marks I have achived can be found <a href="modules.html">here</a>.
    This website details my experiences, skills and projects that I have completed throughout my undergraduate degree and industrial placement. My interests include programming, language learning and ballroom dancing.

  <h2> University Projects </h2>
        <p>
          This page details some of the key projects I have conducted at the University of Surrey.
        </p>
    <div class ="flex-container">
  <div class="university-project">
    <h3> Literature Review: Literature Review of Gastric Emptying Methodology and Mathematical Modelling using the <sup>13</sup>C-Octanoic Acid Breath Test</h3>
    <p> As the title says, this was a literature review covering the topic of gastric emptying. This is a cross-departmental project with
      the department of nutrition and the literature review is currently being modified to prepare for publication.
      The review can be accessed <a href="UniWork/Literature_Review.pdf">here</a>.

  </div>

    <div class="university-project">
      <h3> Design Project: Oligomerisation and separation plant</h3>
      <p> For this project, I designed the merox process, focusing on removing the mercaptans (sulphur containing compounds).
        This included  research, design, equipment sizing, materials of construction selection and thermodynamic validation of the simulation packages.
         I was the safety, health and environment engineer for the overall design, completing dozens of DOW fire and explosive indices, a COMAH analysis and leading a HAZOP on a line.
        The report can be accessed <a href="UniWork/Design_Project.pdf">here</a>.

    <div class="university-project" id="equipmentDesignBlock">
      <h3> Advanced Equipment Design: Furnace Reboiler</h3>
      <p> My partner and I selected the project to complete the advanced design of a furnace reboiler. We produced a detailed process and mechanical design for a
        twin-helical thermosyphon fired-heater reboiler in a four-week period. This was one of the most technically challenging projects allocated that year.
        The report can be accessed <a href="UniWork/Equipment_Design_Report.pdf">here</a>.

  <h2> Programming Projects </h2>
  <p>
    Programming is one of my passions, and some of the programs I am most proud of are presented within this section.
    I currently specialise in Python, but I am currently exploring other languages to further develop my skills.
    I have created an app “Questions and Forfeits” which is published on the Google Play Store which can be found <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.doyouknowme">here</a>
  </p>
  <div class ="flex-container">
  <div class="programming-project">
    <h3>Webscraper - Professional Institute Events</h3>
    <p>This project web scrapes all the training events from various engineering institutes:
      Institute of Chemical Engineers, Institute of Mechanical Engineers, Institute of Civil Engineers etc.
      and formats the results into an excel file. This project uses the scrapy module,
      which whilst more complicated than typical approaches, allows concurrent requests, and hence a much faster crawl.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="Programming/webscraper.png" alt="Example of the results generated" >
      <figcaption>Example of the results generated showing the events taken from the institution websites, currently highlighting the IChemE tab.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <div class="programming-project">
    <h3>Linear graph reader</h3>
    <p>This is a quicker and more accurate method to measure datapoints from a graph. The user can upload an image of a graph,
      calibrate the axes and then they can select any point and will receive the correct reading. They can then optionally
      store the selected value in an excel file. The program also has the option of multiple screen-sizes.
      The source code can be found <a href=" https://github.com/jo763/Linear_Grap_-Plotter">here</a>.

    </figure>
  </div>

  <div class="programming-project">
    <h3>Questions and Forfeits</h3>
    <p> The app is meant to see how well people know each other by asking questions about
            one of the players, whilst the other players need to guess the answer. After all the players have guessed, the player who was asked
            the question reveals the answer and those who got it incorrect forfeits (i.e. takes a drink or does a burpee).
            If there are more than 3 players, additional questions are added including challenge modes, to see who can beat whom in certain competitions.
            Improvements for the app, include the inclusion of more questions,
            as well as topics that can be selected.
            The game can be accessed <a href="Games/DYKM/DYKM.html">here</a>.

  </div>

  <div class="programming-project">
    <h3>Shots and Ladders</h3>
    <p> This was originally designed as a drinking app, it is based upon the concept of Snakes and Ladders. Near-future improvements include a new UI design and graphical improvements.
            The recalibration of the counter placement will be updated soon. Other improvement ideas include: more maps, different play modes etc.
            The game can be accessed <a href="Games/S&L/Shots_And_Ladders0.3.1.html">here</a>.
